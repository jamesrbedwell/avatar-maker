# Avatar Maker

A a little fun side project to take an image with a face in it and try and create a new square image for use in an avatar.

Making assumptions that the nose is somewhere near the middle of the face.

To give it a go.

1. git clone https://github.com/jamesrbedwell/avatar-maker.git
2. npm i or yarn
3. Add your images to the images folder
4. npm start or yarn start
5. check the handy work in the out folder, curently makes png's

_NOTE_ It makes some wild assumptions on what size to make the images, and is obviously depending on the api recognising the face accuratley. (adam's apples and necks with shadows seem to throw it off.)
